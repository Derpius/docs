In the past weeks, we\'ve been working on improving and adding small features to common actions such as firing, picking up objects and even how you perceive them happening. Here\'s the highlights!\\n\\n\\n## New Weapon Animations\\n\\nSince the beginning, our weapons were stiff when shooting giving an impression of rigidity and lack of fluidity. With the simple improvement of adding firing animations to that, look how it looks better:\\n\\n<video controls=\\"true\\" allowfullscreen=\\"true\\">\\n    <source src=\\"/videos/blog/weapons-improvements/m1911.mp4\\" type=\\"video/mp4\\" />\\n</video>\\n\\n<video controls=\\"true\\" allowfullscreen=\\"true\\">\\n    <source src=\\"/videos/blog/weapons-improvements/makarov.mp4\\" type=\\"video/mp4\\" />\\n</video>\\n\\n\\n## New effects for Bullet Shells\\n\\nBesides new animations, we added a subtle detail: **Bullet Shells Drop SFX**. And not that simple! The sound is precisely played in the location and moment the shells hit the ground or any surface, listen:\\n\\n<video controls=\\"true\\" allowfullscreen=\\"true\\">\\n    <source src=\\"/videos/blog/weapons-improvements/bullet-shell-drop.mp4\\" type=\\"video/mp4\\" />\\n</video>\\n\\nCheck out a complete before and after comparison of some of the weapons, you can notice all the improvements in detail!\\n\\n<iframe width=\\"620\\" height=\\"347\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ln4AUntcyLM\\" title=\\"YouTube video player\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n\\n<br />\\n<br />\\n\\nNote that nanos world weapons animations and aiming are completely generated procedurally, that means when you are in First Person, the weapon sight location is calculated dynamically to be positioned right in the middle of your eyes, in a true first person mode.\\n\\n\\n## SFX when Picking Up objects\\n\\nA subtle sound detail added when you grab and drop a Weapon, and also now the object is slightly thrown to forward:\\n\\n<video controls=\\"true\\" allowfullscreen=\\"true\\">\\n    <source src=\\"/videos/blog/weapons-improvements/picking-up.mp4\\" type=\\"video/mp4\\" />\\n</video>\\n\\n\\n## Scopes\\n\\nIs is really easy to add attachable objects in any Weapon, for example attaching a AWP Scope, we use the `SM_Scope_25x56` mesh for that:\\n\\n```lua\\n-- Spawns a AWP Weapon\\nlocal weapon = Weapon(location or Vector(), rotation or Rotator(), \\"nanos-world::SK_AWP\\")\\n\\n-- Attaches a Scope mesh, with configured offset to be perfectly aligned\\nweapon:AddStaticMeshAttached(\\"sight\\", \\"nanos-world::SM_Scope_25x56\\", \\"\\", Vector(20, 0, 11))\\n\\n-- Adjusts Sight Location to put the Sniper at exact location where the scope center will be when ADS\\nweapon:SetSightTransform(Vector(-15, 0, -4.6), Rotator(0, 0, 0))\\n```\\n\\n<video controls=\\"true\\" allowfullscreen=\\"true\\">\\n    <source src=\\"/videos/blog/weapons-improvements/sniper-scope.mp4\\" type=\\"video/mp4\\" />\\n</video>\\n\\nThis is completely procedural, it also uses the 3D Mesh scope materials!\\n\\n\\n:::tip\\n\\nYou can also check the [Official Weapons Package](https://github.com/nanos-world/nanos-world-weapons), and see how a RedDot has been added to a P90!\\n\\n:::\\n\\nThat\'s it!

And with that we made several improvements, including the addition of categories in the sidebar, new tabs and even new stuff to spawn! Not to mention several bug fixes and the overall usability has been improved! No more movement blocked when opening the Spawn Menu!\\n\\n<video controls=\\"true\\" allowfullscreen=\\"true\\">\\n    <source src=\\"/videos/blog/sandbox-improvements/new-sandbox-ui.mp4\\" type=\\"video/mp4\\" />\\n</video>\\n\\n\\n## New Props \ud83d\udce6\\n\\nWe\'re importing a big pack of props that will come with the base game.\\n\\nWe\'ve been debating a lot what the threshold is between shipping the game with several props or shipping it with no props and just allowing the player to download whatever they want from the Vault. It\'s a tough decision, but for now we\'ve decided to deliver a basic pack with some cool stuff, including new **Construction Props**, **Fruits**, **Tools** and even new **Weapons**!\\n\\n![](/img/blog/sandbox-improvements/new-props.jpg)\\n\\n\\n## NPCs \ud83e\udd16\\n\\nIt\'s been in there for some time, but we\'d like to highlight it! On Spawn Menu now there is a new tab which allows spawning NPCs.\\n\\nThose NPCs has some basic functionality defined in Lua, they walk around randomly and even run away when they are threatened! Insane!\\n\\n<video controls=\\"true\\" allowfullscreen=\\"true\\">\\n    <source src=\\"/videos/blog/sandbox-improvements/npcs.mp4\\" type=\\"video/mp4\\" />\\n</video>\\n\\n## New Weapons  \ud83d\udd2b\\n\\nThis is not strictly related to Sandbox game-mode, but besides the new Props, we are shipping brand new and configured Weapons in the `nanos-world-weapons` default package!\\n\\nThis includes a P90, UMP-45, M1911 Pistol and many other!\\n\\n<video controls=\\"true\\" allowfullscreen=\\"true\\">\\n    <source src=\\"/videos/blog/sandbox-improvements/new-weapons.mp4\\" type=\\"video/mp4\\" />\\n</video>\\n\\n\\n## Weapons Pattern \ud83c\udfa8\\n\\nBesides the categories in the left-side, we are starting to add a new section to be our \\"options section\\", we started by adding a new option in the Weapons tab: **Patterns**.\\n\\n![](/img/blog/sandbox-improvements/weapon-pattern.jpg)\\n\\n![](/img/blog/sandbox-improvements/weapon-pattern-floor.jpg)\\n\\n![](/img/blog/sandbox-improvements/weapon-pattern-infernoo.jpg)\\n\\nYou can change and select any pattern from the hundreds included in the game to be applied in your weapon (it is synchronized with other players as well)! It\'s is really easy to add your own `.jpg` as pattern in the menu!\\n\\n<video controls=\\"true\\" allowfullscreen=\\"true\\">\\n    <source src=\\"/videos/blog/sandbox-improvements/weapons-pattern.mp4\\" type=\\"video/mp4\\" />\\n</video>\\n\\n\\n## Breakable Props \ud83c\udf49\\n\\nThis is an awesome feature which I\'ve been working in the last weeks, it\'s something 100% scripting side, I\'m not sure yet if this should become a built-in thing.\\n\\n<video controls=\\"true\\" allowfullscreen=\\"true\\">\\n    <source src=\\"/videos/blog/sandbox-improvements/breakable-watermelon.mp4\\" type=\\"video/mp4\\" />\\n</video>\\n\\nBut now on Sandbox we can configure Props to break when Hit or TakeDamage! It is also possible to easily configure which debris will be generated, it\'s randomness and much more, see an example:\\n\\n```lua\\nSetBreakableProp(\\"nanos-world::SM_Fruit_Watermelon_01\\", 700, {\\n\\t{ mesh = \\"nanos-world::SM_Fruit_Watermelon_01_Half_01\\", rotation = Rotator() },\\n\\t{ mesh = \\"nanos-world::SM_Fruit_Watermelon_01_Half_01\\", rotation = Rotator(180, 0, 0) },\\n\\t{ mesh = \\"nanos-world::SM_Fruit_Watermelon_01_Crust_01\\" },\\n\\t{ mesh = \\"nanos-world::SM_Fruit_Watermelon_01_Slice_01\\" },\\n\\t{ mesh = \\"nanos-world::SM_Fruit_Watermelon_01_Slice_01\\" },\\n})\\n```\\n\\nAnd voila every time a Watermelon spawns through the Spawn Menu, it will be breakable!\\n\\n\\n## Explosive Props \ud83d\udca5\\n\\nIn a sub-category as Breakable Props, we can have Explosive ones! Which will not only break if they take damage or get Hit, but will also EXPLODE! Causing damage, and even start a chain reaction of explosions!\\n\\n<video controls=\\"true\\" allowfullscreen=\\"true\\">\\n    <source src=\\"/videos/blog/sandbox-improvements/chain-explosions.mp4\\" type=\\"video/mp4\\" />\\n</video>\\n\\n<video controls=\\"true\\" allowfullscreen=\\"true\\">\\n    <source src=\\"/videos/blog/sandbox-improvements/gas-house-explosion.mp4\\" type=\\"video/mp4\\" />\\n</video>\\n\\n<video controls=\\"true\\" allowfullscreen=\\"true\\">\\n    <source src=\\"/videos/blog/sandbox-improvements/gas-explosion-danger.mp4\\" type=\\"video/mp4\\" />\\n</video>\\n\\nAs you can see it can be very dangerous to play with fire! \ud83d\ude05\\n\\n\\n## What\'s next! \ud83d\udca1\\n\\nWe are currently working on making everything ready for the official Alpha 1.0.0 release! We are slowly distributing Beta Keys to some testers, this way we can calmly fix some last bugs and give the finishing touches before the full launch!\\n\\nWe\'ve also implemented a LOT of new content for modding & scripting that will still be announced in the next weeks! This will make a HUGE changelog list so probably I will highlight all features in separated Blog News!\\n\\nThat\'s all for this blog! Thank you so much for all your support! \ud83e\udd70\\n\\n<video controls=\\"true\\" allowfullscreen=\\"true\\">\\n    <source src=\\"/videos/blog/sandbox-improvements/watch-teaser.mp4\\" type=\\"video/mp4\\" />\\n</video>"},{"id":"alpha","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/alpha","editUrl":"https://github.com/nanos-world/docs/edit/master/blog/2021-09-01-alpha.md","source":"@site/blog/2021-09-01-alpha.md","title":"nanos world is coming to Alpha!","description":"So long has passed since we started developing nanos world.

We will now have two branches `stable/latest` and `bleeding-edge`, we intend to keep the default branch as stable as possible, while working in upcoming content in the *bleeding-edge* branch.\\n\\nBy default all testers will have access to *bleeding-edge* to be able to help us testing the new features before releasing them officially! Also in the docs we are going to have two versions which represent each of the branch!\\n\\n:::info\\n\\nThe version **a1.0.0** is already present in *bleeding-edge* branch and will come to *stable* as soon as possible!
